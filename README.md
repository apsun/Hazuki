# Hazuki

> Let's reinvent the wheel, but make it square!

Hazuki is a lightweight portable C library which provides commonly used
data structures and algorithms. It is very immature and is **not**
meant to be used in production code! Use at your own risk!

Named after [Hazuki Tachibana](https://vndb.org/c20285).
